This is made for SER316 for Assignment 5 to show working knowledge of design patterns.

I want to do a structural type design pattern since I feel as if they make the most sense to me and they are the most interesting. I am going to use a composite pattern to create a school and sort schoolmates depending on their grade level and if they are classmates. A sort of school scheduling system that can keep track of its students. I am doing a bunch of students since we need to treat a bunch of objects in a similar way.
